🩺 Health & Lifestyle Analysis (K-Means Clustering Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of health and lifestyle factors — such as age, BMI, daily steps, sleep hours, and gender — to uncover patterns among individuals.
Using K-Means clustering, the project groups people into clusters based on similar habits and health conditions.

🎯 Objectives

Understand how different lifestyle choices affect health outcomes

Identify groups (clusters) of individuals with similar health profiles

Visualize health patterns using PCA

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

pandas, numpy → Data handling

matplotlib, seaborn → Visualizations

scikit-learn → Scaling, Encoding, K-Means, PCA

📊 Key Steps

Data Loading & Inspection – Checked structure, missing values, and data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized age, BMI, steps, and sleep hours

Preprocessing – Encoded gender, filled missing data, scaled features

Clustering (K-Means) – Created 3 lifestyle-based clusters

PCA Visualization – Reduced to 2D and plotted clusters

🧩 Results

Individuals were grouped into 3 lifestyle clusters:

Cluster 0: Active & Healthy

Cluster 1: Moderate Lifestyle

Cluster 2: High Risk (low activity, high BMI, poor sleep)

PCA visualization clearly showed separation between groups.
